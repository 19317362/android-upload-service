Currently `HttpURLConnection` (the default) and `OkHttp` are supported. You can also implement your own.\r\n* be able to set library log level and to provide custom logger implementation\r\n\r\nAt the core of the library there is a `Service` which handles multiple concurrent upload tasks in the background. It publishes broadcast intents to notify status. This way the logic is completely decoupled from the UI.
